# Truss-Analysis
Matrix Analysis of Truss Structure

What the project does?

  This is the Program to calculate 3D Truss Structure using Matrix Analysis Method.
By giving input data of truss structures, loads and restrains, The program will from the structure stiffness matrix 
and will calculate deformations of the structure.

Why the project is useful?

  I am architectural graduated from Thailand. Now I am studying master course structural analysis in Japan. 
Being new with both python programing and structural analysis, this small project took me around 4 months to finish.
If you are someone who is trying to program your own structural analysis program, I hope this repository can help.

How users can get started with the project?

  The repository includes 3 parts
  1. Input.py
  2. Analysis.py
  3. render.py
  
Users can create input data of truss structures, loads and restrains in "Analysis.py" and 
output data will be given with a render.
